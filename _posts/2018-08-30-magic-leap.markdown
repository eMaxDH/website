"Can you share some of your thoughts on #photonics as it relates to spacial computing (i.e. Magic Leap)?"[2][qoto_user_absolutus]

My first thought was, how does the display work?

I found a patent from Magic Leap, Inc.
Maybe the Magic Leap One works like this =)

In order to obtain a real 3D image, it is necessary to create a light field as if from a real object.
This can be done by modulating the wave field, e.g. as a sphere, Fig. 2A[pat]. 
When we "see" such a spherical light field, it looks as if it comes from a (virtual) point source.

The patent describes the stacking of the light-guid optical elements to a 3D display (WRAP), see Fig. 5A[3][pat].

By using a beam deflector, any 3D pixel can be addressed. The result is that the calculated virtual environment can be projected into the wearer's eyes.

Some interesting points of the patent
- Section 0034: limited number of slices of a 3D volume ("...less than 16 to 36 or more...")
- Section 0036: How is the light field generated?
- Section 0048 ff: WRAP device
- Section 0052 ff.: How the WRAP works (in particular section 0055f)

Please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.
